##  JavaScript ProtoTypical Inherittance

####  Initialize with a constructorobject
##### An object can have a constructor method where state is defined when an instance is intialized

####  ProtoTypical

#####  Rather than adding functions to an instance.  It makes more sense to add it to the object's prototype this saves memory in not defining a method that all instances share.  All of the instances inherit functionality from its prototype.
